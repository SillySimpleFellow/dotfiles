NOTED: These are my personal configuration files, which could be changed as I develop my environment on macOS.

## Showcase

## Installation
Clone repository to your local device and `cd` into it:
```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/khoad51/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
```

Then run the setup script:
```shell script
$ source bootstrap
```

This might take quite a while as it needs to download and install several tools.

After script execution finish, reload your `zsh` config file:
```shell script
$ source ~/.zshrc
```
